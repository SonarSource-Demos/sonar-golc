## Introduction

![logo](imgs/Logob.png)

**GoLC** is a clever abbreviation for "Go Line Counter," drawing inspiration from [CLOC](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc "AlDanial") and various other line-counting tools in Go like [GCloc](https://github.com/JoaoDanielRufino/gcloc "João Daniel Rufino").

**GoLC** counts physical lines of source code in numerous programming languages supported by the Developer, Enterprise, and Data Center editions of [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/knowledge/languages/) across your Bitbucket Cloud, Bitbucket Data Center, GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repositories.
GoLC can be used to estimate LoC counts that would be produced by a Sonar analysis of these projects, without having to implement this analysis.

GoLC The tool analyzes your repositories and identifies the largest branch of each repository, counting the total number of lines of code per language for that branch. At the end of the analysis, a text and PDF report is generated, along with a JSON results file for each repository.It starts an HTTP service to display an HTML page with the results.

> This last version is ver1.0.4 is available for Bitbucket Cloud , Bitbucket DC, GitHub , GitLab , Azure DevOps and Files.A Docker version is available.

## Installation

You can install from the stable release by clicking [here](https://github.com/emmanuel-colussi-sonarsource/sonar-golc/releases/tag/V1.0.4)

## Prerequisites 

* A personal access tokens for : Bitbucket Cloud,Bitbucket DC,GitHub, GitLab and Azure DevOps.The token must have repo scope.
     - Perform pull request actions
     - Push, pull and clone repositories
  
* [Go language installed](https://go.dev/) : If you want to use the sources...


## Supported languages

To show all supported languages use the subcommand languages :

 ```
$:> golc.go -languages

 ❗️ To add a new language, you need to add an entry to the Languages structure defined in the file [assets/languages.go](assets/languages.go).


 ## Usage

 ✅ Environment Configuration

 Before running GoLC, you need to configure your environment by initializing the various values in the config.json file.
 Copy the **config_sample.json** file to **config.json** and modify the various entries.

 ```json

This file represents the 6 supported platforms for analysis: BitBucketSRV (Bitbucket DC), BitBucket (cloud), GitHub, GitLab, Azure (Azure DevOps), and File. Depending on your platform, for example, Bitbucket DC (enter BitBucketSRV), specify the parameters:

 ```json
"Users": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx" : Your User login
"AccessToken": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx" : Your Token
"Organization": "xxxxxx": Your organization
 ```

If '**Projects**' and '**Repos**' are not specified, the analysis will be conducted on all repositories. You can specify a project name (PROJECT_KEY) in '**Projects**', and the analysis will be limited to the specified project. If you specify '**Repos**' (REPO_SLUG), the analysis will be limited to the specified repositories.
```json
"Project": "",
"Repos": "",
```
❗️ The '**Projects**' entry is supported exclusively on the BitBucket and AzureDevops platform.

For Bitbucket DC, you must provide the URL with your server address and change the '**Protocol**' entry if you are using an https connection , ending with '**/**'. The '**Branch**' input allows you to select a specific branch for all repositories within an organization or project, or for a single repository. For example, if you only want all branches to be "main", '**"Branch":"main"**' .
```json
 "Url": "http://X.X.X.X/"
 ```
You can create a **.cloc_'your_platform'_ignore** file to ignore projects or repositories in the analysis. 
```json
   "FileExclusion":".cloc_bitbucketdc_ignore"
```
The syntax of this file is as follows for BitBucket:

```
REPO_SLUG
PROJECT_KEY 
PROJECT_KEY/REPO_SLUG
```

```
- REPO_SLUG = for one Repository
- PROJECT_KEY = for one Project
- PROJECT_KEY/REPO_SLUG For un Repository in one Project
```

The syntax of this file is as follows for GitHub:

```
REPO1_SLUG
REPO2_SLUG
...
```

```
- REPO1_SLUG = for one Repository
```

The syntax of this file is as follows for File:

```
DIRECTORY_NAME
FILE_NAME
...
```

The syntax of this file is as follows for Azure Devops :

```
PROJECT_KEY/REPO_SLUG
PROJECT_KEY
```

 ✅  Config.json File Settings

❗️ For the **File** mode, if you want to have a list of directories to analyze, you create a **.cloc_file_load** file and add the directories to be analyzed line by line.If the **.cloc_file_load**. file is provided, its contents will override the **Directory** parameter."

❗️ The parameters **'Period'**, **'Factor'**, and **'Stats'** should not be modified as they will be used in a future version.

❗️ The parameters **'Multithreading'** and **'Workers'** initialize whether multithreading is enabled or not, allowing parallel analysis. You can disable it by setting **'Multithreading'** to **false**. **'Workers'** corresponds to the number of concurrent analyses.These parameters can be adjusted according to the performance of the compute running GoLC.

❗️ The boolean parameters **DefaultBranch**, if set to true, specifies that only the default branch of each repository should be analyzed. If set to false, it will analyze all branches of each repository to determine the most important one.

 ✅ Run GoLC

 To launch GoLC with the following command, you must specify your DevOps platform. In this example, we analyze repositories hosted on Bitbucket Cloud. The supported flags for -devops are :
 ```bash
flag : <BitBucketSRV>||<BitBucket>||<Github>||<Gitlab>||<Azure>||<File>

 ```
 ❗️ GoLC runs on Windows, Linux, and OSX, but the preferred platforms are OSX or Linux.

```bash

If the Results directory exists, GoLC will prompt you to delete it before starting a new analysis and will also offer to save the previous analysis. If you respond 'y', a Saves directory will be created containing a zip file, which will be a compressed version of the Results directory.

$:> golc -devops BitBucket

✅ Using configuration for DevOps platform 'BitBucket'

❗️ Directory <'Results'> already exists. Do you want to delete it? (y/n): y
❗️ Do you want to create a backup of the directory before deleting? (y/n): n

## Usage with Docker image

**GoLC** docker images support running both on the amd64 architecture and on arm64-based Apple Silicon.

✅ Pull Images

There are two types of docker images: one for amd64 and one for arm64.The tags are **arm64-1.0.3** and **amd64-1.0.3** .

 ```bash
:> docker pull https://ghcr.io/sonarsource-demos/sonar-golc/golc:arm64-1.0.3
:> docker pull https://ghcr.io/sonarsource-demos/sonar-golc/resultsall:arm64-1.0.3
```

✅ Create volumes to persist data or map a local directory

You need a persistent volume or to map a local directory to store the analysis results.You need to configure your environment by initializing the various values in the config.json file

      - Results: contains the analysis files
